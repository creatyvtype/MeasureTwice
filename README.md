# Measure Twice
DBC Final Project

This app aims to provide a user-friendly tool for simulating furniture arrangement within a given space to take the guesswork out of moving.

Work still in progress.

*This repository has been forked from the originator of this project, Katy Duncan. I did this to display my individual contributions to this project without affecting the main repository. No further development will be completed on this forked repository.

Majd(creatyvtype)'s contribution to this project involved researching and implementing most of the Client Tool using SVG.js. This involved drawing the basic images for the tool, incorporating SVG.js to render the images to scale when clicked, adding the delete and custom furniture features.

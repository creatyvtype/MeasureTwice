# Measure Twice
DBC Final Project

This app aims to provide a user-friendly tool for simulating furniture arrangement within a given space to take the guesswork out of moving.

Work still in progress.

Majd(creatyvtype)'s contribution to this project involved researching and implementing most of the Client Tool using SVG.js. This involved drawing the basic images for the tool, incorporating SVG.js to render the images to scale when clicked, adding the delete and custom furniture features.
